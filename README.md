For my NBO analysis, once we run the code it will first ask for path to log file,then pdb file.
Next it will ask you to input an atom no (start atom) and 2nd atom (target atom) for tracing its bond path. This will give the number of bonds between these atoms and also the path.
Pertubation data,contribution data, classification of interactions, bond range classifications, long range classifications are all made into a seperate txt file.
Both input files(log files and pdb files) and also the output files are uploaded in the repository.
